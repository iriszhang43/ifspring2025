        <p class="markup">[Verse 1]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p> We were both young when I first saw you </p> 
            <p>I close my eyes and the flashback starts</p>
            <p>I'm standin' there</p>
            <p>On a balcony in summer air</p>
            <p>See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns</p>
            <p>See you make your way through the crowd</p>
            <p>And say, "Hello"</p>
            <p>Little did I know</p>
        </div>

        <p class="markup">[Pre-Chorus]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles</p>
            <p>And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"</p>
            <p>And I was cryin' on the staircase</p>
            <p>Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said</p>
        </div>

        <p class="markup">[Chorus]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone</p>
            <p>I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run</p>
            <p>You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess</p>
            <p>It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="markup">[Verse 2]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>So I sneak out to the garden to see you</p>
            <p>We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew</p>
            <p>So close your eyes</p>
            <p>Escape this town for a little while, oh oh</p>
        </div>

        <p class="markup">[Pre-Chorus]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter</p>
            <p>And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"</p>
            <p>But you were everything to me</p>
            <p>I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said</p>
        </div>
        
        <p class="markup">[Chorus]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone</p>
            <p>I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run</p>
            <p>You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess</p>
            <p>It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"</p>
            <p>Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel</p>
            <p>This love is difficult, but it's real</p>
            <p>Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess</p>
            <p>It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"</p>
            <p>Oh, oh</p>
        </div>

        <p class="markup">[Bridge]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I got tired of waiting</p>
            <p>Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around</p>
            <p>My faith in you was fading</p>
            <p>When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said</p>
        </div>

        <p class="markup">[Chorus]</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone</p>
            <p>I keep waiting for you, but you never come</p>
            <p>Is this in my head? I don't know what to think</p>
            <p>He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring</p>
            <p>And said, "Marry me, Juliet</p>
            <p>You'll never have to be alone</p>
            <p>I love you and that's all I really know</p>
            <p>I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress</p>
            <p>It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"</p>
            <p>Oh, oh, oh</p>
            <p>Oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
            <p>'Cause we were both young when I first saw you</p>
